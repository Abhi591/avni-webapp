Your service area is a hierarchy of different locations (eg: district, taluka, village).

A Location is associated with a Location Type. Define Location Types from the Location Types menu option before you start adding Locations.

All Subjects are associated with Locations. The field app requires you to provide this location to the lowest level available in the system.

#### Uploading Locations

You can also upload locations in bulk using the Upload screen. This option will automatically create Location Types.
