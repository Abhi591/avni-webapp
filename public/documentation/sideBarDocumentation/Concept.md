Concepts define the different pieces of information that you collect as part of your service delivery. Concept is the data source backing the Form element. This helps Avni retain and show data even when an element is removed from the form. Concepts can also be reused across forms. e.g. Form elements for Weight captured in Diabetes follow up and Hypertension follow up can each be using same backing concept to track weights captured of the same individual across programs

For example, if you collect the blood pressure of a subject in a form, then **Blood Pressure** should be defined as a concept. You would notice that every question in a form requires a concept
